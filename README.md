More documentation for Tracks can be found within the /doc directory. 

The manual can be found at the website mentioned above. The manual includes
full instructions for both new installations and upgrades from older 
installations of Tracks.

The instructions might appear long and intimidatingly complex, but that is
mostly because of the number of different platforms supported, and the
different configurations which can be used (e.g. running Tracks on your local
computer or on a remote server). If you choose the appropriate section for your
situation (installation vs. upgrade), and use the easiest (recommended) method,
you should find the instructions easy to follow. If you encounter problems, try
searching the wiki, forum or mailing list (URLs above), and ask a question if
you cannot find a solution to your problem.

The wiki has a lot of user contributed installation HOWTOs for various webhosts, 
specific OS's and more.

If you are thinking about contributing towards the development of Tracks,
please read /doc/README_DEVELOPERS for general information. Also you can find
some information on development, testing and contributing on the wiki. And if 
coding is not your thing, we welcome contributions in translations or (updates 
on) HOWTO's on the wiki a lot!

While fully usable for everyday use, Tracks is still a work in progress. Make
sure that you take sensible precautions and back up all your data frequently,
taking particular care when you are upgrading.

Enjoy being productive!
